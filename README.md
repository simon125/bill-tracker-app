# Welcome to bill-tracker-app

Hi! I am so glad that you are here and started read this description. Let me introduce you a little to this project, to be honest this is my second approach to this app, the first one I had to leave because of lot of wrong practices and approaches to couple things, but now with new skills and knowledge I'll do my best to deliver this app to usage state - my first motivation is I finally want to store my whole bills which I was collecting during last year and half.

## Whats going on with that app?

So **bill-tracker-app** is a web app which allows to add, manage, read, review statistics and store bills. Someday I felt that need "I want to know how many I spend where and when I'm doing it" and this triggered that idea to create such app. By the way I constantly develop and improve my technical skills so I couldn't wait long and decide to create bill-tracker and created... I've created version which is almost working properly but couldn't finish it due to bad approach to couple things and so on, and the big killer of this project was to big willing to finish project as soon as possible, which bring only mess. And here there come the new beginning of the app...

### I invite you to follow the project, feel free to reporting bugs features ideas pullrequests.

# Let's talk about technical stuff

The core word is **MERN** stack so, in general project would be create in JavaScript on the front-end side and server side as well.

- M - MongoDB NoSQL database
- E - ExpressJS NodeJS framework which really brings a lot of fun in creating back-end in JS
- R - ReactJS Front-end framework first framework which I've learned and still learning and could say my favorite one
- N - NodeJS - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8

In general that's that...

This project will involve much more technologies and tools but it would be hard to list them all, but more important:

- CircleCI for automation builds and deployments
- Heroku platform to hosting apps
- GIT / Github / GitKraken
- Trello
- [moqups.com/](https://moqups.com/) app for creating mockups

**Front-end**

- Redux/Redux-thunk
- Redux-form or Formik haven't decided yet
- Chart.js and Rechart - know that seems silly to use 2 libs for charts but wanted to test
- Moment, Lodash,
- Antdesing

**Back-end**

- Don't remember now but for sure I'll update it.

## These things should be enough for now, I need to add some code xD wish me luck and wait for the results :)
